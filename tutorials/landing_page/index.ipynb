For example, specifying $\\alpha$ to be item-specific is equivalent to adding an item-level fixed effect.\n",
    "2. Observables ($X$, $Y$, $\\dots$) to be constant, user-specific, item-specific, session-specific, or (session, item) (such as price) and (session, user) (such as income) specific as well.\n",

    "\n",
    "This flexibility in coefficients and features allows for more than 20 types of additive terms to $U_{uis}$, which enables modelling rich structures.\n",

    "Overall, the `torch-choice` package offers the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The package includes a data management module called `ChoiceDataset`, which is built upon PyTorch's dataset module. Our dataset implementation allows users to easily move data between CPU and GPU. Unlike traditional long or wide formats, the `ChoiceDataset` offers a memory-efficient way to manage observables.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The package provides a (1) conditional logit model and (2) a nested logit model for consumer choice modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The package leverage GPU acceleration using PyTorch and easily scale to large dataset of millions of choice records. All models are trained using state-of-the-art optimizers by in PyTorch. These optimization algorithms are tested to be scalable by modern machine learning practitioners. However, you can rest assure that the package runs flawlessly when no GPU is used as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Setting up the PyTorch training pipelines can be frustrating. We provide easy-to-use [PyTorch lightning](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai) wrapper of models to free researchers from the hassle from setting up PyTorch optimizers and training loops.\n"
