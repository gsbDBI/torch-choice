    "*From Stata Documentation*: Choice models (CM) are models for data with outcomes that are choices. The choices are selected by a decision maker, such as a person or a business (i.e., the **user**), from a set of possible alternatives (i.e., the **items**). For instance, we could model choices made by consumers who select a breakfast cereal from several different brands. Or we could model choices made by businesses who chose whether to buy TV, radio, Internet, or newspaper advertising.\n",
    "\n",
    "Models for choice data come in two varieties—models for discrete choices and models for rank-ordered alternatives. When each individual selects a single alternative, say, he or she purchases one box of cereal, the data are discrete choice data. When each individual ranks the choices, say, he or she orders cereals from most favorite to least favorite, the data are rank-ordered data. Stata has commands for fitting both discrete choice models and rank-ordered models."

    "## Data Layout\n",
    "In the following parts, we demonstrate how to convert a data by Stata to data format expected by our package.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Why do we want another `ChoiceDataset` object instead of just one data-frame?*: In earlier versions of Stata, we can only have one single data-frame loaded in memory, this would introduce memory error especially when teh dataset is large. For example, you have a dataset of a million decisions recorded, each consists of four items, and each item has a persistent *built quality* that stay the same in all observations. The Stata format would make a million copy of these variables, which is very inefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "We would need to collect a couple of data-frames as the essential pieces to build our `ChoiceDataset`. Don't worry, as soon as you have the data-frames ready, the `EasyDataWrapper` helper class would take care of the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "We call a single statistical observation a **\"purchase record\"** and use this terminology throughout the tutorial. "

For example, the first 4 rows of the dataset (see above) has `consumerid == 1`, this means we should look at the first 4 rows together and they constitute the first purchase record.\n",
    "2. `item_name_column`: a column identifies **names of items**, which is `car` in the dataset above. This column provides information above the availability as well. As mentioned above, there is no column with `car == Korean` in the fourth purchasing record (`consumerid == 4`), so we know that Korean car was not available that time.\n",
    "3. `choice_column`: a column identifies the **choice** made by the consumer in each purchase record, which is the `purchase` column in our example. Exactly one row per purchase record (i.e., rows with the same values in `purchase_record_column`) should have 1, while the values are zeros for all other rows.\n",
    "4. `user_index_column`: a *optional* column identifies the **user** making the choice, which is also `consumerid` in our case.\n",
    "5. `session_index_column`: a *optional* column identifies the **session** of the choice, which is also `consumerid` in our case."

    "1. Suppose `SESSION_INDEX` column in `df_main` is the index of the session, `ALTERNATIVES` column is the index of the car.\n",
