    "This tutorial aim to show how to manage choice datasets using the `torch-choice` package, we will follow the Stata documentation [here](https://www.stata.com/manuals/cm.pdf) to offer a seamless experience for the user to transfer prior knowledge in other packages to our package."

    "*From Stata Documentation*: Choice models (CM) are models for data with outcomes that are choices. The choices are selected by a decision maker, such as a person or a business (i.e., the **user**), from a set of possible alternatives (i.e., the **items**). For instance, we could model choices made by consumers who select a breakfast cereal from several different brands. Or we could model choices made by businesses who chose whether to buy TV, radio, Internet, or newspaper advertising.\n",
    "\n",
    "Models for choice data come in two varieties—models for discrete choices and models for rank-ordered alternatives. When each individual selects a single alternative, say, he or she purchases one box of cereal, the data are discrete choice data. When each individual ranks the choices, say, he or she orders cereals from most favorite to least favorite, the data are rank-ordered data. Stata has commands for fitting both discrete choice models and rank-ordered models."

    "# Motivations\n",
    "In the following parts, we demonstrate how to convert a long-format data (e.g., the one used in Stata) to the `ChoiceDataset` data format expected by our package.\n",
    "\n",
    "But first, *Why do we want another `ChoiceDataset` object instead of just one long-format data-frame?*\n",
    "In earlier versions of Stata, we can only have one single data-frame loaded in memory, this would introduce memory error especially when teh dataset is large. For example, you have a dataset of a million decisions recorded, each consists of four items, and each item has a persistent *built quality* that stay the same in all observations. The Stata format would make a million copy of these variables, which is very inefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "We would need to collect a couple of data-frames as the essential pieces to build our `ChoiceDataset`. Don't worry, as soon as you have the data-frames ready, the `EasyDataWrapper` helper class would take care of the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "We call a single statistical observation a **\"purchase record\"** and use this terminology throughout the tutorial. "

    "# Components of the Consumer Choice Modelling Problem\n",
    "We begin with essential component of the consumer choice modelling problem. Walking through these components should help you understand what kind of data our models are working on.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purchasing Record\n",
    "Each row (record) of the dataset is called a **purchasing record**, which includes *who* bought *what* at *when* and *where*.\n",
    "Let $B$ denote the number of **purchasing records** in the dataset (i.e., number of rows of the dataset). Each row $b \\in \\{1,2,\\dots, B\\}$ corresponds to a purchase record (i.e., *who* bought *what* at *where and when*).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Items and Categories\n",
    "To begin with, there are $I$ **items** indexed by $i \\in \\{1,2,\\dots,I\\}$ under our consideration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, the researcher can optionally partition the set items into $C$ **categories** indexed by $c \\in \\{1,2,\\dots,C\\}$. Let $I_c$ denote the collection of items in category $c$, it is easy to verify that\n",

    "\n",
    "If the researcher does not wish to model different categories differently, the researcher can simply put all items in one single category: $I_1 = \\{1, 2, \\dots I\\}$, so that all items belong to the same category.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: since we will be using PyTorch to train our model, we represent their identities with integer values instead of the raw human-readable names of items (e.g., Dell 24 inch LCD monitor).\n",
    "Raw item names can be encoded easily with [sklearn.preprocessing.OrdinalEncoder](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.OrdinalEncoder.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Users\n",
    "Each purchaing reocrd is naturally associated with an **user** indexed by $u \\in \\{1,2,\\dots,U\\}$ (*who*) as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sessions\n",
    "Our data structure encompasses *where and when* using a notion called **session** indexed by $s \\in \\{1,2,\\dots, S\\}$.\n",
    "For example, when the data came from a single store over the period of a year. In this case, the notion of *where* does not matter that much, and session $s$ is simply the date of purchase.\n",

    "Another example is that we have the purchase record from different stores, the session $s$ can be defined as a pair of *(date, store)* instead.\n",

    "# Format the Dataset a Little Bit\n",
    "The wrapper we built requires several data frames, providing the correct information is all we need to do in this tutorial, the data wrapper will handle the construction of `ChoiceDataset` for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: The dataset in this tutorial is a bit over-simplified, we only have one purchase record for each user in each session, so the `consumerid` column identifies all of the user, the session, and the purchase record (because we have different dealers for the same type of car, we define each purchase record of it's session instead of assigning all purchase records to the same session).\n",
    "That is, we have a single user makes a single choice in each single session.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **main dataset** should contain the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `purchase_record_column`: a column identifies **purchase record** (also called **case** in Stata syntax). this tutorial, the `consumerid` column is the identifier. For example, the first 4 rows of the dataset (see above) has `consumerid == 1`, this means we should look at the first 4 rows together and they constitute the first purchase record.\n",
    "2. `item_name_column`: a column identifies **names of items**, which is `car` in the dataset above. This column provides information above the availability as well. As mentioned above, there is no column with `car == Korean` in the fourth purchasing record (`consumerid == 4`), so we know that Korean car was not available that time.\n",
    "3. `choice_column`: a column identifies the **choice** made by the consumer in each purchase record, which is the `purchase` column in our example. Exactly one row per purchase record (i.e., rows with the same values in `purchase_record_column`) should have 1, while the values are zeros for all other rows.\n",
    "4. `user_index_column`: a *optional* column identifies the **user** making the choice, which is also `consumerid` in our case.\n",
    "5. `session_index_column`: a *optional* column identifies the **session** of the choice, which is also `consumerid` in our case.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might have noticed, the `consumerid` column in the data-frame identifies multiple pieces of information: `purchase_record`, `user_index`, and `session_index`. This is not a mistake, you can use the same column in `df` to supply multiple pieces of information. "

    "## Method 2: Adding Observables as Data Frames\n",
    "We can also construct data frames and use data frames to supply different observables. This is useful when you have a large dataset, for example, if there are many purchase records for the same user (to be concrete, say $U$ users and $N$ purchase records for each user, resulting $U \\times N$ total purchase records). Using a single data-frame requires a lot of memory: you need to store $U \\times N$ entires of user genders in total. However, user genders should be persistent across all purchasing records, if we use a separate data-frame mapping user index to gender of the user, we only need to store $U$ entries (i.e., one for each user) of gender information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the long-format data requires storing each piece of item-specific information for number of purchase records times, which leads to inefficient usage of disk/memory space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Do Observable Data-frame Look Like?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our package natively support the following four types of observables:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **User Observables**: user-specific observables (e.g., gender and income) should (1) have length equal to the number of unique users in the dataset (885 here); (2) contains a column named as `user_index_column` (`user_index_column` is a variable, the actual column name should be the **value** of variable `user_index_column`! E.g., here the user observable data-frame should have a column named `'consumerid'`); (3) the user observable can have any number of other columns beside the `user_index_column` column, each of them corresponding to a user-specific observable. For example, a data-frame containing $X$ user-specific observables has shape `(num_users, X + 1)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Item Observables** item-specific observables (not shown in this tutorial) should be (1) have length equal to the number of unique items in the dataset (4 here); (2) contain a column named as `item_index_column` (`item_index_column` is a variable, the actual column name should be the **value** of variable `item_index_column`! E.g., here the item observable data-frame should have a column named `'car'`); (3) the item observable can have any number of other columns beside the `item_index_column` column, each of them corresponding to a item-specific observable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Session Observable** session-specific observables (not shown in this tutorial) should be (1) have length equal to the number of unique sessions in the dataset; (2) contain a column named as `session_index_column` (`session_index_column` is a variable, the actual column name should be the **value** of variable `session_index_column`! E.g., here the session observable data-frame should have a column named `'consumerid'`); (3) the session observable can have any number of other columns beside the `session_index_column` column, each of them corresponding to a session-specific observable.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Price Observables** (session, item)-specific observables (e.g., dealers) should be (1) contains a column named as `session_index_column` (e.g., `consumerid` in our example) **and** a column named as `item_name_column` (e.g., `car` in our example), (2) the price observable can have any number of other columns beside the `session_index_column` and `item_name_column` columns, each of them corresponding to a (session, item)-specific observable. For example, a data-frame containing $X$ (session, item)-specific observables has shape `(num_sessions, num_items, X + 2)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We encourage the reader to review the *Data Management Tutorial* for more details on types of observables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Suggested Procedure of Storing and Loading Data\n",
    "1. Suppose `SESSION_INDEX` column in `df_main` is the index of the session, `ALTERNATIVES` column is the index of the car.\n",
    "2. For user-specific observables, you should have a CSV on disk with columns {`consumerid`, `var_1`, `var_2`, ...}.\n",
    "3. You load the user-specific dataset as `user_obs = pd.read_csv(..., index='consumerid')`."
